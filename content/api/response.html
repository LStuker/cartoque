Response format and conventions
===============================

This page describes some common conventions we use in the API.

Format
------

When a request succeeds, the format used in the response depends on the requested one. We strongly encourage you to use **JSON**, i.e. ask for ``http://.../../<something>.json`` in your requests.

For instance, if you ask for ``http://your-cartoque-server/servers.json``, you'll get a list of your servers in json format.

Other formats are natively supported by the applications but should not be used within the API :

  - **html** : it's for humans, hey!
  - **pdf** : same here.
  - **csv** : only used for ``/servers`` and ``/applications`` for now, might disappear in the future ; NOT DOCUMENTED
  - **xml** : same as **csv**, most likely to be removed in the next release since the world now has **json** :)

HTTP Response code
------------------

We'll use the same HTTP status code as everywhere. Here's a list of the subset we'll use, found in the great [Stripe's API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) :

  - *200 OK* - Everything worked as expected.
  - *400 Bad Request* - Often missing a required parameter.
  - *401 Unauthorized* - No valid API key provided.
  - *402 Request Failed* - Parameters were valid but request failed.
  - *404 Not Found* - The requested item doesn't exist.
  - *500, 502, 503, 504* Server errors - something went wrong on Cartoque's side.


Namespacing conventions
-----------------------

About namespacing objects, we follow the same conventions as [Gaug.es, documented here](http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/12/01/creating-an-api/), if I quote John Nunemaker:

> Again, we decided on a rule. In this case, all top level objects should be name-spaced, but objects referenced from a 
> top level object or a collection of several objects did not require name-spacing.
