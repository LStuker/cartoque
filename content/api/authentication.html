API Authentication
==================

All actions against the REST API need authentication through a custom **authentication token**. This 
authentication token is linked to a user account. It should be passed with every HTTP request as a 
custom HTTP header called **X-Api-Token**.


Creating an authentication token
--------------------------------

* Go to the **Configuration** section in the top menu bar
* Click **Users** in the sidebar
* Either create a new user or edit the one who needs access to the API
* **Generate a token**


Updating an authentication token
--------------------------------

If a user already has an authentication token, you can change it with the same basic steps described above.

But **be careful**: re-generating an authentication token cannot be undone. It means the old one will stop working, 
so if it's used in scripts or 3rd party tools, you'll need to update them with the new authentication token!


Using the authentication token
------------------------------

An example with curl :

    curl -H "X-Api-Token: <token>" <API URL>

Of course you'll have to replace the values. For instance, here is a list of my servers if my token is "abcdef123" :

    curl -sL -H "X-Api-Token: abcdef123" http://cartoque.home/servers.json

See the [list of API endpoints](/api/endpoints.html) for further informations on available URLs, parameters and formats.


Other authentication modes
--------------------------

If you're intested in making other authentication methods possible (such as [Oauth](http://oauth.net)),
