Welcome to Cartoque
===================

**Cartoque** is a free, web-based CMDB tool built to replace an existing PHP application we used to have at work. It's built 
on top of the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework.

Since it's used only at my $WORK for the moment, **I don't recommend you use it in a production environment for now**. Actually, 
it comes with opinionated choices that might not fit your needs (see "Requirements" below). The goal of this project is to make 
the application evolve in a product generic-enough for use in small to medium datacenters. But we don't want to replace MS Access, 
we don't believe too generic products are good for this job. If you're searching a generic CMDB tool, you might want to give a 
try to [iTop](http://www.combodo.com/-Overview-.html).
