Welcome to Cartoque!
====================

**Cartoque** is a free, web-based CMDB tool built to replace an existing application we used to have at work. It's built 
on top of the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework.

<div id="screenshots">
  <div>
	  <a href="./images/screenshots/servers-list-big.png" title="Keep a reference list of your servers, applications, applications instances">
      <img alt="example2" src="./images/screenshots/servers-list-small.png" />
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
	  <a href="./images/screenshots/follow-your-components-big.png" title="Follow your components: operating systems, app servers, databases, etc.">
      <img alt="example2" src="./images/screenshots/follow-your-components-small.png" />
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
	  <a href="./images/screenshots/manage-contacts-big.png" title="Manage your contacts">
      <img alt="example2" src="./images/screenshots/manage-contacts-small.png" />
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

The app may not be totally ready for your use case *now*, but I'd really love to [hear your thoughts or feedback](https://github.com/jbbarth/cartoque/issues) !
The goal of this project is to make the original application evolve in a product generic-enough for use in any small to medium datacenter.  Actually today
the application comes with opinionated choices that might not fit your needs (see <%= link_to "Requirements", "/guide/install.html" %>) but I'm ready to
discuss them with you.

In the next few months I'll be 100% focused on improving documentation, making it easier to install, and making it better for everybody who'd like to use it.
