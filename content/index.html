Welcome to Cartoque!
====================

**Cartoque** is a free, web-based CMDB tool built to replace an existing PHP application we used to have at work. It's built 
on top of the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework.

The app may not be 100% ready for your use case now, but I'd really love to [hear your thoughts or feedback](https://github.com/jbbarth/cartoque/issues) !
In the next few months I'll be 100% focused on improving documentation, making it easier to install, and making it better for everybody who'd like to use it.
Actually today the application comes with opinionated choices that might not fit your needs (see <%= link_to "Requirements", "/guide/install.html" %>) but
I'm ready to discuss them with you. The goal of this project is to make the original application evolve in a product generic-enough for use in small to
medium datacenters.
