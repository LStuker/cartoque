Welcome to Cartoque!
====================

**Cartoque** is a free, web-based CMDB tool built to replace an existing PHP application we used to have at work. It's built 
on top of the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework.

The app may not be totally ready for your use case *now*, but I'd really love to [hear your thoughts or feedback](https://github.com/jbbarth/cartoque/issues) !
In the next few months I'll be 100% focused on improving documentation, making it easier to install, and making it better for everybody who'd like to use it.
The goal of this project is to make the original application evolve in a product generic-enough for use in any small to medium datacenter.  Actually today
the application comes with opinionated choices that might not fit your needs (see <%= link_to "Requirements", "/guide/install.html" %>) but I'm ready to
discuss them with you.
