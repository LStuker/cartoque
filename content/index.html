Welcome to Cartoque!
====================

**Cartoque** is a free, web-based CMDB tool built to replace an existing PHP application we used to have at work. It's built 
on top of the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web framework.

The app may not be 100% ready for your use case now, but I'd really love to [hear your thoughts or feedback](https://github.com/jbbarth/cartoque/issues) ! 
It comes with opinionated choices that might not fit your needs (see <%= link_to "Requirements", "/guide/install.html" %>) but I'm reluctant to discuss it. 
The goal of this project is to make the original application evolve in a product generic-enough for use in small to medium datacenters.
