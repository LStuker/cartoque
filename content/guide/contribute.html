Reporting bugs and contributing
===============================

If you have any issue, feel free to report an issue [on the Github bug tracker](https://github.com/jbbarth/cartoque/issues) with a detailed description of your problem and minimal steps to reproduce.

If you want to contribute, you're welcome ! We plan to work with Github's forks and pull requests, but please fill an issue before developing any additional feature. The general idea is we won't integrate new features if they're too specific, tightly coupled to your infrastructure, or untested.
