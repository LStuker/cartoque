Installation instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------

If you want to install Cartoque, you need to check the following requirements are met :

* **Clients**: clients should use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera) ; IE support is blocked 
  since I had a lot of problems with it and I cannot test it myself (feel free to fill a new issue about this 
  subject) ; Javascript must be enabled
* **Application server**: you'll need **Ruby 1.9.2-p290 or higher** (previous versions are buggued) and an 
  application server that supports Rails applications ; the installation of these components are out of the 
  scope of this tutorial, but I personnaly run my production environment with Ruby 1.9.2-p290 installed with 
  [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/), and [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) 3.0.x in standalone mode
* **Database server**: MySQL version 5.0 or higher is required (support for Postgresql is untested but might 
  be OK)
* **Authentication**: you can use a CAS server for authentication, but it's no longer required, there's a minimal
  internal authentication with login/password implemented

Installing the application
--------------------------

This section is not complete for the moment. Basically, if you have the correct application stack and you've cloned
the repository, it installs like any Rails 3 web app :

    cd /path/to/cartoque
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    cp config/database.yml{.example,}
    rake db:create db:migrate db:seed

Start the server, open your browser in the correct URL, and you're ready to go !

*NB*: the default login/password (admin@example.net/admin) is advertised on the login page the first time you log in.
Of course, we highly recommend you change it as soon as possible, at least before going into production.
