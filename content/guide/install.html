Installation instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------

* **Clients**: clients should use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera) ; IE support is blocked since this browser is too shitty and I cannot test it extensively (feel free to fill a new issue about this subject) ; Javascript must be enabled
* **Application server**: you'll need *Ruby 1.9.2-p290 or higher* and an application server that supports Rails applications ; the installation of these components are out of the scope of this tutorial, but I personnaly run my production environment with Ruby 1.9.2-p290 installed with "RVM":http://beginrescueend.com/, and "Phusion Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ 3.0.x in standalone mode
* **Database server**: MySQL version 5.0 or higher is required (support for Postgresql is untested but might be OK)
* **Authentication**: a CAS server is required for authentication

Installing the application
--------------------------

This section is not complete for the moment. Basically, if you have a correct application stack and you've cloned the repository, it installs like any Rails 3 web app :

    cd /path/to/cartoque
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate db:seed

Then you can configure the CAS server (replace the CAS server URL, without the trailing slash):

    rails runner 'Settler.load!
    Setting.find_by_key("cas_server").update_attribute(:value, "http://your-cas-server.your-company.com")'

And then add the first user (replace at least the uid):

    rails runner 'User.create(:name => "John", :provider => "cas", :uid => "john.smith")'

You're ready to go !
